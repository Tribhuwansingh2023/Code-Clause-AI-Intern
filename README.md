# Code-Clause-AI-Intern
This repository contains AI projects completed during my CodeClause internship. Projects include: Image Recognition with OpenCV, Facial Recognition System, Road Lane Detection, and Personality Prediction via CV Analysis, using Python, OpenCV, NLP, and machine learning techniques. Each project explores different aspects of AI and computer vision.

1. Image Recognition with OpenCV

Level: Entry-Level
Objective: Build a basic image recognition system using OpenCV.
Description: This project focuses on the implementation of a simple object detection system using image processing techniques with OpenCV in Python. The system can detect predefined objects or faces from images.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV
What I Learned: Image processing, object detection using OpenCV.

2. Facial Recognition System

Level: Intermediate-Level
Objective: Develop a facial recognition system capable of identifying and verifying faces from images or video streams.
Description: A facial recognition system that uses pre-trained models or custom-trained models to detect and recognize faces. The system is built using OpenCV, Dlib, and facial recognition libraries.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, Dlib, Face Recognition libraries
What I Learned: Face detection, feature extraction, biometric verification systems.

4. Road Lane Detection by Processing Video

Level: Golden-Level
Objective: Develop a system that detects and highlights road lanes in video streams.
Description: This computer vision project is designed to identify and mark road lanes in real-time video footage, a critical component of autonomous vehicle navigation or driver assistance systems (ADAS). The system processes each video frame to analyze lane markings.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, Deep Reinforcement Learning frameworks
What I Learned: Computer vision techniques, video processing, lane detection in real-time.

5. Personality Prediction System via CV Analysis

Level: Golden-Level
Objective: Predict an individual's personality traits based on their Curriculum Vitae (CV).
Description: An AI-driven system that analyzes CV content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system extracts relevant information like education, work experience, and skills, and predicts personality traits using sentiment analysis and linguistic patterns.
Technologies: Python, NLP, Machine Learning
What I Learned: Textual analysis, sentiment analysis, personality prediction models.
This repository showcases my journey through various AI and computer vision projects, with a focus on practical applications of machine learning and image processing techniques.
